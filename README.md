# Stormfest (Fabric Mod)
Stormfest is a mod that adds an **Enchanted Music Disc** dropped from Charged Creepers when killed by Skeleton arrows.

Upon playing said disc; a thunderstorm will begin, using up the disc's mystical powers.
After that, the disc can be played normally.

<br>

> If you can farm Charged Creepers, you can farm Stormfest and literally have "lighting in a bottle"
