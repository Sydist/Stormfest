# Stormfest (Fabric Mod) ![version] ![license] 
Stormfest is a mod that adds an **Enchanted Music Disc** dropped from Charged Creepers when killed by Skeleton arrows.

Upon playing the disc; a thunderstorm will begin, using up the disc's mystical powers.
Afterwards, the disc can be played normally like any other.

<br>

> If you can farm Charged Creepers, you can farm Stormfest and literally have "lighting in a bottle"
